I have created a simple landing page using REACT from a psd I got for an interview.
Goal is to use it as a reference in the future:

The landing page looks like this:

Some of the feature in the page:
- Navigation
- Slider
- Tabs
- Content section


**Navigation** is just in the page:

on scroll the bar changes to white, the text logo shows up and the css changes for the links

**Slider** is a slick slider, easy peasy

and there are 2 tabs but I se it up so that you can add more if you need to (variable visibleTab hold the visible tab index)
